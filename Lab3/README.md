The task consists of two parts. Both have the goal of setting up the software "Wordpress" with an external MySQL database using two docker containers, though in part 2 the containers have to be setup first.

# Part 1

In the directory of the docker-compose.yml file open a command line and enter the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

The "-d" stands for "detached", meaning that the composition of the two containers will run in the background.

# Part 2

## Wordpress container

## SQL container

## Deployment



In the directory of the docker-compose.yml file open a command line and enter the following command:

    docker-compose up -d
